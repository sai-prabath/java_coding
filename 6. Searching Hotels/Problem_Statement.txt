6. Searching Hotels - count and search methods:

Create a class Hotel with the below attributes:
hotelld - int 
hotelName - String
dateOfBooking - String (in the format dd-mon-yyyy)
noOfRoomsBooked - int 
wifiFacility - String 
totalBill- double
- The above attributes can be private with write getters, setters (optional)
- use parameterized constructor as required.

Create class Solution with main method.

Implement two static methods in Solution class.
1. noOfRoomsBookedInGivenMonth
2. searchHotelByWifiOption

noOfRoomsBookedInGivenMonth method:
- This method will take two input parameter - array of Hotel objects and a String parameter.
- The method will return the total numbers of rooms booked from array of Hotel objects for the given month(String parameter passed).
- If no rooms are booked for the given month in the array of Hotel objects, then the method should return 0.

searchHotelByWifiOption method:
- This method will take two input parameter - array of Hotel objects and a String parameter
- The method will return Hotel object with second highest totalbill from the array of Hotel objects where wifiFacility attribute matches with the given wifi facility (String parameter passed).
- If no Hotel with the given wifi option is present in the array of Hotel objects, then the method should return null.

The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

For noOfRoomsBookedInGivenMonth method:
- The main method should print the total number of booked rooms as it is, if the returned value is greater than O.
- else it should print "No rooms booked in the given month"

For searchHotelByWifiOption method:
- The main method should print the hotelId from the returned Hotel obiect if the returned value is not null.
- if the returned value is not null then it should print "No such option available"

Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of four Hotel objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence.
Next, read the value of two String parameters for capturing the months and wifi option

Note:
- No two Hotel object would have the same hotelId.
- No two Hotel object would have the same totalbill.
- The Array either has at least two objects with specified wifi option or no object with specified wifi option.
- All the searches should be case insensitive.
- dateOfBooking is stored in the format dd-mon-yyyy(eg. 01-Jan-2022)
