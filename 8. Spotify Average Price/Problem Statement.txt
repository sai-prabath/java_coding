You need to build a simple data processing application for managing subscription plans of a music streaming service. 

Your task is to create a `Spotify` class to represent subscription plans and 
implement a method that calculates the average subscription price based on certain filters.


Class Details

1. Spotify Class:

   - Attributes make attributes private:
     - `id` (int): Unique identifier for each subscription plan.
     - `name` (String): Name of the subscription service (e.g., Spotify, Netflix).
     - `stype` (String): Type of subscription (e.g., monthly, yearly).
     - `price` (double): Price of the subscription plan.
     - `groupsessions` (String): Specifies if group sessions are available ("yes" or "no").

   - Constructor:
     - Initialize the attributes with the given values.
     - Use getters and setters

2. Solution Class:

   - Method:
     - `SearchSpotifyAvg`: This method takes an array of `Spotify` objects and two `String` values `stype` and `groupsessions` as input parameters.
     - It calculates the average price of subscriptions that match the `stype` and `groupsessions` values.
       - If there are matching subscriptions, the method returns the average price.
       - If no matching subscriptions are found, it returns `0`.

3. Input and Output Requirements

- Input:
  - Four sets of data for creating `Spotify` objects, each containing:
    - An integer `id`.
    - A `name` string.
    - A `stype` string indicating the type of subscription (e.g., "monthly", "yearly").
    - A double `price` representing the subscription cost.
    - A `groupsessions` string specifying if group sessions are available ("yes" or "no").
  - Two additional `String` inputs: `s1` and `s2`, representing the subscription type and group session availability to filter for the average price calculation.

- Output:
  - If there are matching subscriptions, print the calculated average price.
  - If no matches are found, print "No such users".

Sample Input:

  1
  netflix
  monthly
  1000
  yes
  2
  prime
  monthly
  2000
  yes
  3
  hotstar
  yearly
  500
  no
  4
  aha
  yearly
  1000
  no
  monthly
  yes

Sample Output:

  1500.0

Explanation:
- The program calculates the average price of subscriptions that are "monthly" and have "yes" for group sessions.
- Here, two subscriptions match these criteria: "netflix" and "prime", with prices 1000 and 2000.
- The average price is `(1000 + 2000) / 2 = 1500.0`.
