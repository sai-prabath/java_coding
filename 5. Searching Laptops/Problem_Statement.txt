Create a class Laptop with the below attributes:

laptopId - int 
brand - String 
osType - String
price - double
rating - int

- use parameterized constructor as required
- set attributes private  and use getters and setters (optional)

Create class Solution with main method.

Implement two static methods in Solution class.
1. countOfLaptopsByBrand
2. searchLaptopByOsType 

countOfLaptopsByBrand method:
- This method will take two input parameters - array of Laptop objects and a String parameter.
- The method will return the count of laptops from array of Laptop object for the given brand(String parameter passed) whose rating is more than 3.
- If no Laptop with the above condition is present in the array of Laptop objects, then the method should return 0.

searchLaptopByOsType method:
- This method will take two input parameters - array of Laptop objects and a String parameter.
- The method will refurn Laptop obiect array in an descending order of their laptopId, from the array of Laptop objects whose os attribute matches with the given OS(String parameter passed).
- If no Laptop with the given OS is present in the array of Laptop objects, then the method should return null.

Note : 
- No two Laptop object would have the same laptopId.
- All the searches should be case insensitive.
- The above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

For countOfLaptopsByBrand method:
The main method should print the count of laptops as it is, if the returned value is greater than 0.
if it's 0 then it should print "The given brand is not available".

For searchLaptopByOsType method:
The main method should print the laptopId and rating from the returned Laptop object array if the returned value is not null.
if the returned value is null then it should print "The given os is not available".

Before calling these static methods in main,
- use Scanner object to read the values of Four Laptop objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence.
- Next, read two String values for capturing brand and os.

Consider below sample input and output:
