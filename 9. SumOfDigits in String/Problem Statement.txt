You are given a task to write a program that processes a string of characters, extracts any digits from it, and calculates their sum.
The program should print the sum if it is less than 15. Otherwise, it should print "No Digits".

Requirements

1. Main Method:
   - In the main method, read a single line of input (string) from the user.
   - Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
   - Code the Implementation
   - After summing all valid digits, check the final value of `count`:
     - If `count` is less than 15, print the value of `count`.
     - If `count` is 15 or more, print "No Digits".

2. Input and Output Requirements:

- Input:
  - A single line of text, which can contain any characters (letters, numbers, symbols, spaces, etc.).

- Output:
  - If the sum of the digits in the input string is less than 15, output the sum.
  - If the sum is 15 or greater, output "No Digits".

Sample Input 1:
  abc123

Sample Output 1:
  6

Explanation:
  - The digits in the input string "abc123" are '1', '2', and '3', which sum up to 6. Since 6 is less than 15, the program outputs 6.

Sample Input 2:
  45xyz8

Sample Output 2:
  No Digits

Explanation:
  - The digits in the input string "45xyz8" are '4', '5', and '8', which sum up to 17. Since 17 is 15 or greater, the program outputs "No Digits".
